## Current task

### T-011: Add comparison source metadata contract

Goal:
Expose source-document metadata for comparison citations so UI clients can render source drawer details for generated comparison answers without making unsupported assumptions from citation IDs alone.

This is a backend/API contract task. T-007 added deterministic fixture-backed comparison generation for `VOO` vs `QQQ`, and that response currently exposes citation metadata but not full comparison source-document details. Add comparison source metadata to the response using only the existing local comparison knowledge pack and selected asset packs. Keep the comparison generator deterministic and fixture-backed. Do not add live external market-data, SEC, issuer, news, brokerage, tax, or LLM calls. Do not render the new metadata on the compare page in this task; that is reserved for T-012.

- overview generation behavior
- retrieval fixture content
- comparison generation behavior
- comparison fixture coverage beyond the existing local comparison pack
- financial safety rules
- advice-boundary rules
- production dependency files

Acceptance criteria:

- `CompareResponse` exposes a `source_documents` field or equivalently named typed field for comparison source metadata.
- Supported generated `VOO` vs `QQQ` comparison responses include source-document metadata for every source document needed by the response citations.
- Reverse-order `QQQ` vs `VOO` comparison responses include source-document metadata bound to the reversed comparison pack and selected assets.
- Each comparison source metadata item includes source document ID, title, publisher, source type, URL, published or as-of date when available, retrieved timestamp, freshness state, official-source flag, and a supporting passage when available.
- Comparison citation IDs used by key differences and the beginner bottom line resolve to source metadata belonging only to the same comparison pack assets.
- Unsupported, unknown, and unavailable comparison responses return no generated factual citations and no source metadata.
- Comparison validation checks that source metadata belongs to the selected comparison pack and does not introduce wrong-asset, stale-unlabeled, unsupported-source, or missing-evidence claims.
- Backend route tests cover the serialized comparison source metadata shape for `/api/compare`.
- Static evals cover comparison source metadata same-pack binding and no live external calls.
- Existing overview generation tests, chat generation tests, comparison generation tests, retrieval fixture tests, citation validation, safety evals, backend route tests, frontend smoke checks, static evals, and quality gate behavior continue to pass.
- No endpoint, test, or CI command makes live external calls.
- No new production dependency is added.
- The main quality gate passes.

Required commands:

- python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_comparison_generation.py tests/integration/test_backend_api.py -q
- python3 evals/run_static_evals.py
- python3 -m compileall backend
- bash scripts/run_quality_gate.sh

Iteration budget:

- Max 3 Codex implementation loops before reporting blockers.

## Completed

### T-010: Add asset page chat panel for fixture-backed assets

Goal:
Add a beginner-facing asset page chat panel that calls the grounded chat API for fixture-backed supported assets and renders citations, source metadata, advice redirects, unsupported states, and insufficient-evidence states.

Completed:

- Added `AssetChatPanel` to asset pages for fixture-backed assets and wired `app/assets/[ticker]/page.tsx` to render it.
- Added a client-side chat workflow with starter prompts, text input, submit control, empty state, loading state, error state, answer state, and explicit advice redirect, unsupported or unknown, and insufficient-evidence labels.
- Added `lib/assetChat.ts` with typed chat response shapes and an injectable `postAssetChat` helper that calls the local relative `/api/assets/{ticker}/chat` endpoint.
- Rendered supported chat answers with direct answer, `why_it_matters`, uncertainty notes, citation chips, and chat source metadata details including title, source type, publisher, published or as-of date, retrieved timestamp, freshness state, official-source badge, source URL, chunk/source IDs, and supporting passage.
- Rendered no-citation copy for educational redirects, unsupported states, and insufficient-evidence states without inventing factual claims.
- Frontend smoke checks now cover the chat panel, local endpoint helper, chat state markers, source metadata hooks, educational redirect copy, unsupported or unknown copy, insufficient-evidence copy, and no live external chat URLs.
- Safety guardrail tests include the new asset chat panel in frontend copy checks.
- T-010 agent journal records that `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, static evals, and the main quality gate passed. The initial `npm test` failed because the new smoke check rejected existing fixture source URLs; the check was narrowed to the new chat helper/component and passed on rerun.
- Remaining documented risk: the frontend chat helper uses the local relative `/api/assets/{ticker}/chat` path, so deployment still needs the frontend and backend served or proxied so that path resolves at runtime.
- Remaining documented risk: frontend coverage is static smoke coverage, not browser automation of typed questions and rendered network responses.

Completion commits:

- `6f51ae2 feat(T-010): add asset page chat panel for fixture-backed assets`
- `167f1b9 chore(T-010): merge asset page chat panel for fixture-backed assets`

### T-009: Add chat source metadata contract

Goal:
Expose source-document metadata for grounded chat citations so UI clients can render source drawer details for chat answers without making unsupported assumptions from citation IDs alone.

Completed:

- Added chat source metadata fields to the backend response models.
- Grounded chat responses now include source-document metadata derived from the selected asset knowledge pack.
- Chat source metadata includes citation ID, source document ID, title, source type, URL, as-of date, retrieved timestamp, freshness state, stale flag, and supporting passage where available.
- Supported grounded chat responses for `AAPL`, `VOO`, and `QQQ` include source metadata for grounded citations.
- Advice-like redirects, unsupported assets, unknown assets, and insufficient-evidence responses continue to return no generated factual citations or source metadata.
- Chat validation now checks response source metadata against selected-pack citation evidence.
- Backend route tests cover the serialized `source_documents` shape.
- Static evals cover chat source metadata same-asset binding and no live external calls.
- T-009 agent journal records that the focused pytest slice, static evals, and main quality gate passed.
- Remaining documented risk: chat source metadata remains deterministic and fixture-backed for the current supported assets.
- Remaining documented risk: UI rendering for the new chat `source_documents` field was not changed in this backend-only task.

Completion commits:

- `8306738 feat(T-009): add chat source metadata contract`

### T-008: Add grounded asset chat pipeline

Goal:
Generate asset-specific chat responses from selected asset knowledge packs, citation mappings, and safety classification.

Completed:

- Added deterministic grounded chat generation in `backend/chat.py`.
- Backend `/api/assets/{ticker}/chat` now uses the grounded chat pipeline for fixture-backed supported assets.
- Supported educational chat works for `AAPL`, `VOO`, and `QQQ`.
- Chat intent handling covers asset identity, stock business basics, ETF holdings or benchmark basics, ETF cost or breadth questions, top risks, recent developments, and beginner educational suitability framing.
- Generated supported chat responses include canonical asset identity, a direct answer, `why_it_matters`, citations when evidence exists, source-backed uncertainty or limits notes, and an educational safety classification.
- Chat citation binding is restricted to source documents and chunks from the selected asset knowledge pack.
- Advice-like questions continue to redirect into educational framing without generated factual claims or citations.
- Unsupported and unknown assets continue to return clear unsupported-scope or unknown states without generated factual claims.
- Static evals and tests cover schema validity, supported chat intents, same-asset citation binding, advice redirects, unsupported states, insufficient-evidence behavior, safety phrasing, and no live external calls.
- T-008 agent journal records that focused chat tests, the required safety/API test slice, static evals, and the main quality gate passed.
- Remaining documented risk: chat generation is deterministic and fixture-backed for `AAPL`, `VOO`, and `QQQ`; unsupported, unknown, or non-fixture-backed assets intentionally return redirect or insufficient-evidence states.
- Remaining documented risk: intent handling is narrow by design and covers only the beginner intents required for this task.
- Remaining documented risk: `ChatResponse` still exposes chat citations as source document and chunk IDs rather than full source-document metadata; richer source drawer behavior would need a later schema/UI extension.

Completion commits:

- `37e6f59 feat(T-008): add grounded asset chat pipeline`
- `dbbab3c chore(T-008): merge grounded asset chat pipeline`

### T-007: Add comparison generation pipeline

Goal:
Generate beginner comparison responses from structured local facts, comparison knowledge packs, source metadata, and citation mappings.

Completed:

- Added deterministic comparison generation in `backend/comparison.py`.
- Backend `/api/compare` now uses `generate_comparison` for fixture-backed comparison responses.
- Supported `VOO` vs `QQQ` comparison generation works in either ticker order.
- Generated ETF comparison responses include canonical left/right assets, supported state, `etf_vs_etf` type, key differences for benchmark, expense ratio, holdings count, breadth, educational role, a beginner bottom line, and citations.
- Comparison citation binding maps generated citation IDs to same-pack source documents, normalized facts, and source chunks from the local comparison knowledge pack.
- Comparison validation covers generated responses and planned claims, including missing citations, wrong-asset citations, stale sources, unsupported source types, and insufficient evidence.
- Unsupported, unknown, or unavailable comparison requests return `unavailable` comparison state without key differences, bottom-line content, or citations.
- Static evals now include the generated comparison contract, reverse ticker order, unavailable states, same-pack citation binding, safety phrase checks, and no network-client imports.
- Focused unit and integration tests were added for comparison generation and `/api/compare`.
- T-007 agent journal records that focused comparison/API tests, static evals, backend compile check, and the main quality gate passed.
- Remaining documented risk: comparison generation is deterministic and fixture-backed for `VOO` vs `QQQ` only; other supported ticker pairs intentionally return an unavailable comparison state until a local comparison pack exists.
- Remaining documented risk: `CompareResponse` exposes citation metadata but not full comparison source documents, so source drawer-style rendering would need a later schema/UI extension if required.

Completion commits:

- `46b05f2 feat(T-007): add comparison generation pipeline`
- `285948d chore(T-007): merge comparison generation pipeline`

### T-006: Add asset overview generation pipeline

Goal:
Generate beginner asset overview responses from structured local facts, source metadata, and citation mappings.

Completed:

- Deterministic overview generation exists in `backend/overview.py`.
- Supported overview generation works for fixture-backed `AAPL`, `VOO`, and `QQQ`.
- Generated overviews include canonical identity, state, freshness metadata, snapshot fields, beginner summary, exactly three top risks, separated recent developments, suitability summary, claims, citations, and source documents.
- Citation IDs generated for claims, summary facts, risks, and recent developments resolve to same-asset sources.
- Unsupported and unknown assets return explicit states without generated factual claims, invented summaries, or citations.
- Backend asset overview, source, and recent routes use generated overview output for fixture-backed assets.
- Tests and static evals cover schema validity, citation coverage, top-risk count, freshness fields, stable/recent separation, unsupported states, safety language, and no live external calls.
- Existing retrieval fixture tests, citation validation, safety evals, backend route tests, frontend smoke checks, static evals, and quality gate behavior pass.

Completed:

- Local retrieval fixture data exists in `data/retrieval_fixtures.json` for `AAPL`, `VOO`, and `QQQ`.
- Retrieval models and services exist in `backend/retrieval.py`.
- Asset knowledge packs include canonical identity, source document metadata, stable chunk IDs, normalized facts, freshness fields, recent-development layer data, and explicit evidence gaps.
- Single-asset retrieval is filtered to the requested asset and does not return wrong-asset evidence.
- Comparison retrieval builds a bounded `VOO` vs `QQQ` comparison pack.
- Tests and static evals check fixture shape, source linkage, asset filtering, freshness metadata, explicit evidence states, and no network-client imports.
- Existing citation validation, safety evals, backend route tests, frontend smoke checks, static evals, and quality gate behavior pass.

### T-004: Add safety guardrail tests

Goal:
Add deterministic safety guardrail tests and eval coverage that detect buy/sell/hold recommendation leakage, personalized allocation advice, unsupported price targets, tax advice, brokerage/trading behavior, and certainty around future returns.

Completed:

- Safety eval cases cover direct buy/sell/hold questions, allocation or position sizing, unsupported price targets, tax advice, brokerage/trading execution, future-return certainty, unsupported assets, and safe educational prompts.
- Static safety evals check backend chat outputs and forbidden output phrases, not only fixture structure.
- Backend chat tests verify advice-like questions redirect into educational framing and return no citations unless grounded in supported asset facts.
- Safety tests assert forbidden phrases do not appear in backend responses, frontend copy, fixture summaries, or comparison output.
- Safe educational prompts continue to produce grounded educational responses.
- Unsupported asset prompts redirect into clear unsupported-scope language.
- Existing citation validation, backend route, frontend smoke, static eval, and quality gate behavior pass.

### T-003: Add citation validation module

Goal:
Add a citation validation module that verifies generated or fixture-backed claims only cite source documents, chunks, or normalized facts that belong to the same asset or comparison pack and support the claim type.

Completed:

- Citation validation module exists in `backend/citations.py`.
- Validator accepts structured claims, citation IDs, source evidence, and asset or comparison-pack context.
- Validator rejects missing citations, nonexistent citations, wrong-asset citations, non-recent sources for recent claims, stale unlabeled sources, unsupported source types, and insufficient evidence.
- Citation eval cases are exercised by deterministic static evals and unit tests.
- Tests cover single-asset claims, comparison claims, recent-development claims, stale/unknown states, and wrong-asset citations.
- Existing backend, frontend, static eval, and quality gate behavior pass.

Goal:
Create the initial frontend structure for search, asset pages, comparison, citation chips, source drawer, freshness labels, stale/unknown states, and glossary popovers.

Completed:

- Next.js frontend app exists at the repo root using TypeScript.
- Routes exist for `/`, `/assets/[ticker]`, and `/compare`.
- Home page provides a ticker search workflow with supported, unsupported, unknown, and example states.
- Asset page renders deterministic fixture-backed stable facts, recent developments, exactly three top risks, citation chips, freshness labels, source drawer, glossary popovers, and stale/unknown treatment.
