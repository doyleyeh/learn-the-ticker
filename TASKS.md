Allowed files:

- SPEC.md
- EVALS.md
- TASKS.md
- docs/learn_the_ticker_technical_design_spec.md

Do not change:

- app/
- components/
- backend/
- lib/
- tests/
- evals/
- package files
- retrieval fixtures

Acceptance criteria:

- SPEC.md reflects PRD v0.2 MVP decisions without contradicting safety/citation rules.
- EVALS.md lists required checks by task category.
- TASKS.md contains 8-12 small backlog headings after T-015.
- Technical design spec is updated only for durable architecture decisions from PRD v0.2.
- No product implementation code is changed.
- Quality gate passes.

Required commands:

- git status --short
- bash scripts/run_quality_gate.sh

Iteration budget:
Max 2 attempts

### T-014: Add beginner chat starter prompts

Goal:
Make the asset-page grounded chat easier for beginners to start by showing asset-aware starter prompts that cover identity, holdings or business model, risks, recent developments, and advice-boundary education.

Completed:

- Updated `components/AssetChatPanel.tsx` with typed deterministic starter prompt intents for identity, stock business model, ETF holdings/exposure, top risk, recent developments, and advice-boundary education.
- Added asset-aware prompt selection so the local stock fixture `AAPL` receives business-model language, while ETF fixtures such as `VOO` and `QQQ` receive holdings and fund-exposure language.
- Preserved the existing local chat submission flow: clicking a starter prompt submits that exact question through the current `postAssetChat` path and leaves loading, error, answer, citation, source metadata, educational redirect, unsupported, and insufficient-evidence rendering in place.
- Added stable frontend markers for smoke checks with `data-chat-starter-group="beginner-prompts"` and per-intent `data-chat-starter-intent` values.
- Added responsive starter prompt styling in `styles/globals.css` so longer beginner questions wrap cleanly and become full-width on narrow viewports.
- Extended frontend smoke checks for starter prompt markers, stock-specific prompt text, ETF-specific prompt text, advice-boundary prompt text, and no live external chat calls.
- Extended safety guardrail tests with explicit forbidden advice-like examples and starter-prompt copy checks.
- T-014 agent journal records that `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_safety_guardrails.py -q`, `python3 evals/run_static_evals.py`, and `bash scripts/run_quality_gate.sh` passed.
- Remaining documented risk: starter prompts remain deterministic and fixture-aware for the current local supported assets `AAPL`, `VOO`, and `QQQ`.
- Remaining documented risk: frontend coverage is static smoke coverage plus typecheck/build; it does not browser-click every starter prompt.

Completion commits:

- `99adaf3 feat(T-014): add beginner chat starter prompts`
- `e12735a chore(T-014): merge beginner chat starter prompts`

### T-013: Add fixture-backed asset name search states

Goal:
Let the home-page search workflow resolve supported fixture-backed assets by ticker or asset name, while preserving clear unsupported, unknown, and multi-match states without live calls or invented facts.

Completed:

- Updated `components/SearchBox.tsx` with deterministic local fixture search resolution over supported asset tickers, names, asset type, exchange, issuer, beginner summaries, claims, facts, and source-document fields.
- Added case-insensitive, trimmed query handling with scoring so exact ticker and name matches rank ahead of broader text matches.
- Added a multi-match state that lists each matching local fixture as an asset-page link instead of silently choosing one.
- Added supported-result rendering with canonical ticker, asset name, asset type, exchange, and issuer when available, and kept the Open action pointed at `/assets/{ticker}` only for a single supported result.
- Preserved unsupported and unknown states with no asset-page link, including explicit no-invented-facts copy for unknown ticker or name searches.
- Updated search helper text and placeholders to include supported name-search examples such as Apple, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, Invesco QQQ Trust, and Nasdaq-100.
- Added search result panel styling in `styles/globals.css`.
- Extended frontend smoke checks with markers for local search resolution, supported result, multi-match result, unsupported result, unknown result, result links, supported fixture name examples, and no live external search calls or `/api/search` call from the fixture-backed home search.
- T-013 agent journal records that `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, backend API pytest, safety pytest, static evals, and the main quality gate passed.
- Remaining documented risk: home search remains deterministic and fixture-backed for the current local `AAPL`, `VOO`, and `QQQ` fixtures only.
- Remaining documented risk: frontend coverage is static smoke coverage plus typecheck/build; it does not browser-type every search query.

Completion commits:

- `8e963c8 feat(T-013): add fixture-backed asset name search states`
- `e1b59db chore(T-013): merge fixture-backed asset name search states`

### T-012: Render comparison source metadata on compare page

Goal:
Render comparison source-document metadata on the compare page so beginners can inspect the sources, freshness, and supporting passages behind generated comparison citations.

Completed:

- Reworked `app/compare/page.tsx` to use a comparison-specific fixture shape from `lib/compare.ts` instead of the older `compareFixture` and left-asset primary-source fallback.
- Added `lib/compare.ts` with deterministic `VOO` vs `QQQ` and `QQQ` vs `VOO` compare-page fixtures, comparison citation IDs for benchmark, expense ratio, holdings count, and educational role, same-pack comparison source documents, and unsupported/unknown unavailable states with no citations or source documents.
- Added `getComparisonCitationMetadata` so compare-page citation chips resolve to the matching comparison source document and related claim context.
- Added `components/ComparisonSourceDetails.tsx` to render comparison source document ID, title, source type, publisher, URL, published or as-of date, retrieved timestamp, freshness state, official-source badge, related comparison claims, and supporting passage.
- Updated `CitationChip` to expose `data-source-document-id` and `data-freshness-state` markers used by comparison source metadata smoke checks.
- Updated compare-page unavailable states so unsupported, unknown, or unavailable comparison pairs show an unavailable comparison source-pack label and explicitly avoid factual citation chips or source drawers.
- Added source-context list styling in `styles/globals.css`.
- Extended frontend smoke checks to cover comparison source metadata markers, chip-to-source linkage markers, official-source display, freshness display, supporting passages, absence of live compare calls, absence of `/api/compare` calls from the fixture-backed compare page, and absence of `AAPL` sources in comparison metadata.
- Extended safety guardrail frontend-copy coverage to include `components/ComparisonSourceDetails.tsx` and `lib/compare.ts`.
- T-012 agent journal records that `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, focused comparison/API pytest, safety pytest, static evals, and the main quality gate passed. The initial `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` required one focused revision to make smoke citation markers literal and narrow the comparison bottom-line value.
- Remaining documented risk: comparison source rendering remains deterministic and fixture-backed for the existing local `VOO` vs `QQQ` / `QQQ` vs `VOO` comparison pack only.
- Remaining documented risk: frontend coverage is static smoke coverage plus build/typecheck; it does not browser-click citation chips to verify scrolling or focus behavior.

Completion commits:

- `b5f1d1d feat(T-012): render comparison source metadata on compare page`
- `ecacb1b chore(T-012): merge render comparison source metadata on compare page`

### T-011: Add comparison source metadata contract

Goal:
Expose source-document metadata for comparison citations so UI clients can render source drawer details for generated comparison answers without making unsupported assumptions from citation IDs alone.

Completed:

- Added `source_documents` to `CompareResponse`.
- Updated deterministic comparison generation so citation bindings carry both citation metadata and full `SourceDocument` metadata built from same-pack comparison source fixtures.
- Supported `VOO` vs `QQQ` comparison responses now include deduplicated source-document metadata for cited comparison facts and supporting chunks.
- Reverse-order `QQQ` vs `VOO` comparison responses include source-document metadata bound to the reversed local comparison pack and selected assets.
- Unavailable, unsupported, and unknown comparison responses return empty key differences, no beginner bottom line, no factual citations, and no source documents.
- Comparison validation now checks source metadata after citation validation and rejects missing citation metadata, wrong-asset source documents, stale sources, unsupported source types, and empty supporting passages.
- Backend route tests cover serialized `/api/compare` source metadata, including source document ID, title, publisher, source type, URL, published or as-of date, retrieved timestamp, freshness state, official-source flag, and supporting passage.
- Unit tests cover schema-valid source-backed comparison metadata, reverse-order metadata, unavailable responses with no metadata, and validation failures for missing, wrong-asset, stale, unsupported, and insufficient source metadata.
- Static evals cover comparison source metadata same-pack binding, reverse-order source binding, required source metadata fields, unavailable responses with no source metadata, and no live external calls.
- T-011 agent journal records that focused comparison/API tests, static evals, backend compile check, and the main quality gate passed.
- Remaining documented risk: comparison source metadata is deterministic and fixture-backed for the existing local `VOO` vs `QQQ` comparison pack only.
- Remaining documented risk: UI rendering of comparison `source_documents` was intentionally not included in this backend/API contract task.

Completion commits:

- `f9313b1 feat(T-011): add comparison source metadata contract`
- `e9b9c7f chore(T-011): merge comparison source metadata contract`

### T-010: Add asset page chat panel for fixture-backed assets

Goal:
Add a beginner-facing asset page chat panel that calls the grounded chat API for fixture-backed supported assets and renders citations, source metadata, advice redirects, unsupported states, and insufficient-evidence states.

Completed:

- Added `AssetChatPanel` to asset pages for fixture-backed assets and wired `app/assets/[ticker]/page.tsx` to render it.
- Added a client-side chat workflow with starter prompts, text input, submit control, empty state, loading state, error state, answer state, and explicit advice redirect, unsupported or unknown, and insufficient-evidence labels.
- Added `lib/assetChat.ts` with typed chat response shapes and an injectable `postAssetChat` helper that calls the local relative `/api/assets/{ticker}/chat` endpoint.
- Rendered supported chat answers with direct answer, `why_it_matters`, uncertainty notes, citation chips, and chat source metadata details including title, source type, publisher, published or as-of date, retrieved timestamp, freshness state, official-source badge, source URL, chunk/source IDs, and supporting passage.
- Rendered no-citation copy for educational redirects, unsupported states, and insufficient-evidence states without inventing factual claims.
- Frontend smoke checks now cover the chat panel, local endpoint helper, chat state markers, source metadata hooks, educational redirect copy, unsupported or unknown copy, insufficient-evidence copy, and no live external chat URLs.
- Safety guardrail tests include the new asset chat panel in frontend copy checks.
- T-010 agent journal records that `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, static evals, and the main quality gate passed. The initial `npm test` failed because the new smoke check rejected existing fixture source URLs; the check was narrowed to the new chat helper/component and passed on rerun.
- Remaining documented risk: the frontend chat helper uses the local relative `/api/assets/{ticker}/chat` path, so deployment still needs the frontend and backend served or proxied so that path resolves at runtime.
- Remaining documented risk: frontend coverage is static smoke coverage, not browser automation of typed questions and rendered network responses.

Completion commits:

- `6f51ae2 feat(T-010): add asset page chat panel for fixture-backed assets`
- `167f1b9 chore(T-010): merge asset page chat panel for fixture-backed assets`

### T-009: Add chat source metadata contract

Goal:
Expose source-document metadata for grounded chat citations so UI clients can render source drawer details for chat answers without making unsupported assumptions from citation IDs alone.

Completed:

- Added chat source metadata fields to the backend response models.
- Grounded chat responses now include source-document metadata derived from the selected asset knowledge pack.
- Chat source metadata includes citation ID, source document ID, title, source type, URL, as-of date, retrieved timestamp, freshness state, stale flag, and supporting passage where available.
- Supported grounded chat responses for `AAPL`, `VOO`, and `QQQ` include source metadata for grounded citations.
- Advice-like redirects, unsupported assets, unknown assets, and insufficient-evidence responses continue to return no generated factual citations or source metadata.
- Chat validation now checks response source metadata against selected-pack citation evidence.
- Backend route tests cover the serialized `source_documents` shape.
- Static evals cover chat source metadata same-asset binding and no live external calls.
- T-009 agent journal records that the focused pytest slice, static evals, and main quality gate passed.
- Remaining documented risk: chat source metadata remains deterministic and fixture-backed for the current supported assets.
- Remaining documented risk: UI rendering for the new chat `source_documents` field was not changed in this backend-only task.

Completion commits:

- `8306738 feat(T-009): add chat source metadata contract`

### T-008: Add grounded asset chat pipeline

Goal:
Generate asset-specific chat responses from selected asset knowledge packs, citation mappings, and safety classification.

Completed:

- Added deterministic grounded chat generation in `backend/chat.py`.
- Backend `/api/assets/{ticker}/chat` now uses the grounded chat pipeline for fixture-backed supported assets.
- Supported educational chat works for `AAPL`, `VOO`, and `QQQ`.
- Chat intent handling covers asset identity, stock business basics, ETF holdings or benchmark basics, ETF cost or breadth questions, top risks, recent developments, and beginner educational suitability framing.
- Generated supported chat responses include canonical asset identity, a direct answer, `why_it_matters`, citations when evidence exists, source-backed uncertainty or limits notes, and an educational safety classification.
- Chat citation binding is restricted to source documents and chunks from the selected asset knowledge pack.
- Advice-like questions continue to redirect into educational framing without generated factual claims or citations.
- Unsupported and unknown assets continue to return clear unsupported-scope or unknown states without generated factual claims.
- Static evals and tests cover schema validity, supported chat intents, same-asset citation binding, advice redirects, unsupported states, insufficient-evidence behavior, safety phrasing, and no live external calls.
- T-008 agent journal records that focused chat tests, the required safety/API test slice, static evals, and the main quality gate passed.
- Remaining documented risk: chat generation is deterministic and fixture-backed for `AAPL`, `VOO`, and `QQQ`; unsupported, unknown, or non-fixture-backed assets intentionally return redirect or insufficient-evidence states.
- Remaining documented risk: intent handling is narrow by design and covers only the beginner intents required for this task.
- Remaining documented risk: `ChatResponse` still exposes chat citations as source document and chunk IDs rather than full source-document metadata; richer source drawer behavior would need a later schema/UI extension.

Completion commits:

- `37e6f59 feat(T-008): add grounded asset chat pipeline`
- `dbbab3c chore(T-008): merge grounded asset chat pipeline`

### T-007: Add comparison generation pipeline

Goal:
Generate beginner comparison responses from structured local facts, comparison knowledge packs, source metadata, and citation mappings.

Completed:

- Added deterministic comparison generation in `backend/comparison.py`.
- Backend `/api/compare` now uses `generate_comparison` for fixture-backed comparison responses.
- Supported `VOO` vs `QQQ` comparison generation works in either ticker order.
- Generated ETF comparison responses include canonical left/right assets, supported state, `etf_vs_etf` type, key differences for benchmark, expense ratio, holdings count, breadth, educational role, a beginner bottom line, and citations.
- Comparison citation binding maps generated citation IDs to same-pack source documents, normalized facts, and source chunks from the local comparison knowledge pack.
- Comparison validation covers generated responses and planned claims, including missing citations, wrong-asset citations, stale sources, unsupported source types, and insufficient evidence.
- Unsupported, unknown, or unavailable comparison requests return `unavailable` comparison state without key differences, bottom-line content, or citations.
- Static evals now include the generated comparison contract, reverse ticker order, unavailable states, same-pack citation binding, safety phrase checks, and no network-client imports.
- Focused unit and integration tests were added for comparison generation and `/api/compare`.
- T-007 agent journal records that focused comparison/API tests, static evals, backend compile check, and the main quality gate passed.
- Remaining documented risk: comparison generation is deterministic and fixture-backed for `VOO` vs `QQQ` only; other supported ticker pairs intentionally return an unavailable comparison state until a local comparison pack exists.
- Remaining documented risk: `CompareResponse` exposes citation metadata but not full comparison source documents, so source drawer-style rendering would need a later schema/UI extension if required.

Completion commits:

- `46b05f2 feat(T-007): add comparison generation pipeline`
- `285948d chore(T-007): merge comparison generation pipeline`

### T-006: Add asset overview generation pipeline

Goal:
Generate beginner asset overview responses from structured local facts, source metadata, and citation mappings.

Completed:

- Deterministic overview generation exists in `backend/overview.py`.
- Supported overview generation works for fixture-backed `AAPL`, `VOO`, and `QQQ`.
- Generated overviews include canonical identity, state, freshness metadata, snapshot fields, beginner summary, exactly three top risks, separated recent developments, suitability summary, claims, citations, and source documents.
- Citation IDs generated for claims, summary facts, risks, and recent developments resolve to same-asset sources.
- Unsupported and unknown assets return explicit states without generated factual claims, invented summaries, or citations.
- Backend asset overview, source, and recent routes use generated overview output for fixture-backed assets.
- Tests and static evals cover schema validity, citation coverage, top-risk count, freshness fields, stable/recent separation, unsupported states, safety language, and no live external calls.
- Existing retrieval fixture tests, citation validation, safety evals, backend route tests, frontend smoke checks, static evals, and quality gate behavior pass.

Completion commits:

- `0f4fd70 feat(T-006): add asset overview generation pipeline`
- `910761c Merge pull request #6 from doyleyeh/agent/T-006-20260420T214313Z`

Goal:
Create local fixture data and retrieval contracts for supported stocks and ETFs without live external calls in CI.

Completed:

- Local retrieval fixture data exists in `data/retrieval_fixtures.json` for `AAPL`, `VOO`, and `QQQ`.
- Retrieval models and services exist in `backend/retrieval.py`.
- Asset knowledge packs include canonical identity, source document metadata, stable chunk IDs, normalized facts, freshness fields, recent-development layer data, and explicit evidence gaps.
- Single-asset retrieval is filtered to the requested asset and does not return wrong-asset evidence.
- Comparison retrieval builds a bounded `VOO` vs `QQQ` comparison pack.
- Tests and static evals check fixture shape, source linkage, asset filtering, freshness metadata, explicit evidence states, and no network-client imports.
- Existing citation validation, safety evals, backend route tests, frontend smoke checks, static evals, and quality gate behavior pass.

- `ef731a3 agent(T-005): implement current task`
- `92c54c9 Merge pull request #5 from doyleyeh/agent/T-005-20260420T205818Z`

### T-004: Add safety guardrail tests

Goal:
Add deterministic safety guardrail tests and eval coverage that detect buy/sell/hold recommendation leakage, personalized allocation advice, unsupported price targets, tax advice, brokerage/trading behavior, and certainty around future returns.

Completed:

- Safety eval cases cover direct buy/sell/hold questions, allocation or position sizing, unsupported price targets, tax advice, brokerage/trading execution, future-return certainty, unsupported assets, and safe educational prompts.
- Static safety evals check backend chat outputs and forbidden output phrases, not only fixture structure.
- Backend chat tests verify advice-like questions redirect into educational framing and return no citations unless grounded in supported asset facts.
- Safety tests assert forbidden phrases do not appear in backend responses, frontend copy, fixture summaries, or comparison output.
- Safe educational prompts continue to produce grounded educational responses.
- Unsupported asset prompts redirect into clear unsupported-scope language.
- Existing citation validation, backend route, frontend smoke, static eval, and quality gate behavior pass.

Completion commits:

- `3be6ff1 agent(T-004): implement current task`
- `08f68d0 Merge pull request #4 from doyleyeh/agent/T-004-20260420T182024Z`

### T-003: Add citation validation module

Goal:
Add a citation validation module that verifies generated or fixture-backed claims only cite source documents, chunks, or normalized facts that belong to the same asset or comparison pack and support the claim type.

Completed:

- Citation validation module exists in `backend/citations.py`.
- Validator accepts structured claims, citation IDs, source evidence, and asset or comparison-pack context.
- Validator rejects missing citations, nonexistent citations, wrong-asset citations, non-recent sources for recent claims, stale unlabeled sources, unsupported source types, and insufficient evidence.
- Citation eval cases are exercised by deterministic static evals and unit tests.
- Tests cover single-asset claims, comparison claims, recent-development claims, stale/unknown states, and wrong-asset citations.
- Existing backend, frontend, static eval, and quality gate behavior pass.

- `72535b7 Merge pull request #3 from doyleyeh/agent/T-003-20260420T054020Z`

### T-002: Create frontend Next.js skeleton

Goal:
Create the initial frontend structure for search, asset pages, comparison, citation chips, source drawer, freshness labels, stale/unknown states, and glossary popovers.

Completed:

- Next.js frontend app exists at the repo root using TypeScript.
- Routes exist for `/`, `/assets/[ticker]`, and `/compare`.
- Home page provides a ticker search workflow with supported, unsupported, unknown, and example states.
- Asset page renders deterministic fixture-backed stable facts, recent developments, exactly three top risks, citation chips, freshness labels, source drawer, glossary popovers, and stale/unknown treatment.
- Compare page renders a deterministic `VOO` vs `QQQ` comparison.
- Frontend copy stays educational and avoids buy/sell/hold, allocation, price target, tax, and brokerage behavior.
- Frontend smoke checks and Next build run in the quality gate.
- `package-lock.json` is committed so CI can run `npm ci`.
